# Exploration of Naive Bayes Classifiers 

## Goal 
Apply a Naive bayes classifier to the Iris dataset. Classify samples into species groups based on petal and sepal measurements. 

## Files 
GaussianNaiveBayes.ipynb -> Exploration of how the Naive bayes classifier was applied and its results
Iris_data.csv -> the well known Iris dataset. Used as sample data for this project.
