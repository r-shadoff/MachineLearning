# Evaluating a random-forest classifier for forensic pheontype prediction

## Goal
1. Train and evaluate a random forest classifier to predict the hair and eye colour of a sample based on genotype data from 24 SNP loci.
2. Compare the performance of the classifier to pheontype predictions generated by a commercial pheontype-prediction algorithm. 

## Files
multiclass_classifier.R -> R script. Predates the markdown document and was used to develop the analysis pipeline.
PhenotypeClassifer.Rmd -> R markdown containing all code used to generate the final report
PhenotypeClassifier.html -> An html report on the performance of the classifier, supported by confusion matrices and AUC ROC plots.

## Input Data Format
The data used to test this script will not be released as it is protected under REB protocols.
If you wish to use this classifier on your own dataset, two input files are required and must follow the format outlined here. 

1. The first file should be a .tsv with these columns: Sample ID, Hair Colour, Eye Colour
2. The second file should include columns containing: Sample ID, SNP1 Genotype, SNP2 Genotype, SNP3 Genotype .... SNPn Genotype.

## Intended Output Metrics and Plots
1. ROC AUC curves for each hair colour and eye colour class
2. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, Prevalenced, Detection Rate, Detection Prevalence, and Balanced Accuracy for each class
